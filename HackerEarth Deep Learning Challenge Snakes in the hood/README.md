## Problem statement

Sneaky and slimy snakes have lately been creating a ruckus in your neighborhood. Two weeks ago, a toddler, crawling in the backyard, was bitten by one of them. But, thanks to the quick action of a few first-responders, the snakebite did not end up being fatal. Therefore, owing to the increasing number of such reported incidents, the local government body and wildlife rescue units have alerted the residents of your locality.

Until the authorities find a resolution to this, a few tech-savvy neighbors have decided to build a smart reptile-monitoring system that detects snakes in security camera footage and alerts all households in the vicinity. As a Machine Learning expert, your job in the team is to build a sophisticated Deep Learning model that detects the breed of a snake from a given image.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of over 5000 images of 35 varying breeds.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge encourages you to apply your unsupervised Deep Learning skills to build a model that detects the breed of a snake from its image.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of image processing, which is one of the advanced fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
We challenge you to build a model that successfully identifies and detects the breed of a snake.
