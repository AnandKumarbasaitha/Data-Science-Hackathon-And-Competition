We're all hungry. -Yeah,\\r\\nget out of the kitchen, Ron! -Feet off the table! -Feet off the table!\\r\\n\\r\\n-Feet off the table! l love magic. Get your Quidditch World Cup programs\\r\\nhere! Blimey, Dad. How far up are we? Well, put it this way: lf it rains. .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .you'll be the first to know. Father and l are in the minister's box.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . . .by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself. Don't boast,\\r\\nDraco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself, won't you?\\r\\nWhile you can. Come on up. Take your seats. l told you these seats would be\\r\\nworth waiting for. Come on! lt's the lrish! There's Troy! -And Mullet! -And\\r\\nMoran! Ireland! Ireland! Ireland! -Here come the Bulgarians! -Yes! Who's\\r\\nthat? That, sis, is the best Seeker in the world. Krum! Krum! Krum! Krum!\\r\\n\\r\\nYes! Good evening! As Minister for Magic. . . . . .it gives me great\\r\\npleasure. . . . . .to welcome each and every one of you. . . . . .to the\\r\\nfinal of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup! Let the match.          begin!\\r\\n\\r\\nKrum! Krum! Krum! There's no one like Krum. -Krum? -Dumb Krum? He's like a\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbird, the way he rides the wind. -He's more than an athlete. -Dumb Krum.\\r\\nHe's an artist. -l think you're in love, Ron. -Shut up. Viktor, I love you\\r\\nViktor, I do When we're apart My heart beats only for you Sounds like the\\r\\nlrish have got their pride on. Stop! Stop it! lt's not the lrish. We've\\r\\ngotta get out of here. Now! Get out, it's the Death Eaters! Get back to the\\r\\nPortkey, everybody, and stick together! Fred, George! Ginny is your\\r\\nresponsibility. Go! Harry! -Keep up, you lot! -Harry! Harry! Harry!\\r\\n\\r\\nMorsmordre! Harry! -Where are you? -Harry! We've been looking for you for\\r\\nages! Thought we lost you, mate. What is that? Stupefy! Stop! That's my\\r\\nson! -Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right? -We came back for Harry. Which\\r\\nof you conjured it? -Crouch, you can't possi-- -Do not lie! You've been\\r\\ndiscovered at the scene of the crime. -Crime? -Barty! They're just kids.\\r\\nWhat crime? lt's the Dark Mark, Harry. lt's his mark. What, Voldemort?\\r\\n\\r\\nThose people tonight, in the masks, they're his too, aren't they? -His\\r\\nfollowers? -Yeah. Death Eaters. -Follow me. -There was a man, before.\\r\\nThere! All of you, this way! A man, Harry? Who? l don't know. l didn't see\\r\\nhis face. Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley? Anything\\r\\nfrom the trolley, dears? Packet of Drooble's. . . . . .and a Licorice Wand.\\r\\nOn second thought, just the Drooble's. -lt's all right, l'll get it. Don't\\r\\nworry. -Just the Drooble's. Thanks. Two Pumpkin Pasties, please. Thank you.\\r\\nAnything sweet for you, dear? Oh, no, l'm not hungry. Thank you. Anything\\r\\nfrom the trolley? This is horrible. How can the Ministry not know who\\r\\nconjured it? Wasn't there any security or. . .? Loads, according to Dad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses. lt's\\r\\nhurting again, isn't it? Your scar. l'm fine. You know Sirius will want to\\r\\nhear about this. . . . . .what you saw at the World Cup and the dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nHedwig. There we go. Clear the runway! Well, there's something you don't\\r\\nsee every day. Well, now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make\\r\\nan announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.but home to some very special guests as well. You see, Hogwarts has been\\r\\nchosen. . . . Yes, what is it? What is it? Tell them to wait. Tell them to\\r\\nwait. Wait. So Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event: The\\r\\nTriwizard Tournament. -For those of you who do not know. . . -Brilliant. .\\r\\n\\r\\n. .the Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools. . . . . .for a\\r\\nseries of magical contests. From each school, a single student is selected\\r\\nto compete. Now let me be clear. lf chosen, you stand alone. And trust me\\r\\nwhen l say. . . . . .these contests are not for the faint-hearted. But more\\r\\nof that later. For now, please join me in welcoming. . . . . .the lovely\\r\\nladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. . . . . .and their\\r\\nheadmistress, Madame Maxime. Bloody hell. Blimey. That's one big woman. And\\r\\nnow our friends from the north. Please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . . .and their high master, lgor Karkaroff. Oh, it's Krum! Blimey, it's\\r\\nhim! Viktor Krum! Albus. lgor. Professor Dumbly-dorr, my horses have\\r\\ntraveled a long way. -They will need attending to. -Don't worry, Madame\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaxime. Our gamekeeper, Hagrid, is more than capable of seeing to them. But\\r\\nyou know, Monsieur Hagrid. . . . . .they drink only single-malt whiskey.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou idiot! Your attention, please! l'd like to say a few words. Eternal\\r\\nglory. That is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament.\\r\\nBut to do this, that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely\\r\\ndangerous tasks. -Wicked. -Wicked. For this reason, the Ministry has seen\\r\\nfit to impose a new rule. To explain all this. . . . . .we have the head of\\r\\nthe Department of lnternational Magical Cooperation. . . . . .Mr. Bartemius\\r\\nCrouch. Bloody hell. lt's Mad-Eye Moody. -Alastor Moody? The Auror? -Auror?\\r\\nDark-wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, these days. -My dear old\\r\\nfriend, thanks for coming. -Stupid ceiling. Thank you. What's that he's\\r\\ndrinking, do you suppose? l don't know, but l don't think it's pumpkin\\r\\njuice. After due consideration. . . . . .the Ministry has concluded that,\\r\\nfor their own safety. . . . . .no student under the age of 1 7. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.shall be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\n-This decision is final. -That's rubbish! That's rubbish! You don't know\\r\\nwhat you're doing! -Silence! -They're not too happy about that, then. The\\r\\nGoblet of Fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves to the tournament. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . .need only write their name upon a piece of parchment.          and\\r\\n\\r\\nthrow it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so\\r\\nlightly. lf chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, the\\r\\nTriwizard Tournament has begun. Alastor Moody. Ex-Auror.          Ministry\\r\\n\\r\\nmalcontent. . . . . .and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. l\\r\\nam here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end. Any\\r\\nquestions? When it comes to the Dark Arts. . . . . .l believe in a\\r\\npractical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many\\r\\nUnforgivable Curses there are? -Three, sir. -And they are so named? Because\\r\\nthey are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will-- Will earn you a\\r\\none-way ticket to Azkaban, correct. The Ministry says you're too young to\\r\\nsee what these curses do. l say different! You need to know what you're up\\r\\nagainst! You need to be prepared. You need to find another place to put\\r\\nyour chewing gum. . . . . .besides the underside of your desk, Mr.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinnigan! No way. The old codger can see out the back of his head. And hear\\r\\nacross classrooms! So which curse shall we see first? -Weasley! -Yes?\\r\\n\\r\\nStand. Give us a curse. Well, my dad did tell me about one. The lmperius\\r\\nCurse. Oh, yeah, your father would know all about that. Gave the Ministry\\r\\nquite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.\\r\\n\\r\\nHello. Lovely little beauty. Engorgio. Imperio! Don't worry. lt's\\r\\ncompletely harmless. lf she bites. . . . . .she's lethal. What are you\\r\\nlaughing at? Get off! Talented, isn't she? What should l have her do next?\\r\\nJump out the window? Drown herself? Scores of witches and wizards have\\r\\nclaimed. . . . . .that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding.          under\\r\\n\\r\\nthe influence of the lmperius Curse. But here's the rub: How do we sort out\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe liars? Another, another. Up, up. Come on. Longbottom, is it? Up.\\r\\nProfessor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology. There's the.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . The Cruciatus Curse. Correct, correct. Come, come. Particularly\\r\\nnasty. The torture curse. Crucio! Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering\\r\\nhim? Stop it! Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable Curse, Miss\\r\\nGranger. No? Avada Kedavra! The Killing Curse. Only one person is known to\\r\\nhave survived it. . . . . .and he's sitting in this room. Brilliant, isn't\\r\\nhe? Completely demented, of course, and terrifying to be in the same room\\r\\nwith. . . . . .but he's really been there, you know? He's looked evil in\\r\\nthe eye. There's a reason those curses are unforgivable. To perform them in\\r\\na classroom. . . . l mean, did you see Neville's face? Neville? Son? You\\r\\nall right? Come on. We'll have a cup of tea. l want to show you something.\\r\\nWe're gonna be late! Come on, Cedric. Put it in! Eternal glory. Be\\r\\nbrilliant, wouldn't it? Three years from now, when we're old enough to be\\r\\nchosen. Yeah, rather you than me. Yes! Thank you, thank you. -Well, lads,\\r\\nwe've done it. -Cooked it up just this morning. lt's not going to work.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Oh, yeah? -And why is that, Granger? You see this? This is an Age Line.\\r\\nDumbledore drew it himself. So? So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't\\r\\npossibly be fooled. . . . . .by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an\\r\\nAging Potion. -But that's why it's so brilliant. -Because it's so\\r\\npathetically dimwitted. -Ready, Fred? -Ready, George. -Bottoms up. -Bottoms\\r\\nup. -Yes! -Yes! Yeah! Yes! Ready? -Yes! -Yes! -You said! -You said! -Oh,\\r\\nright, you want a piece of me?! -l'll tear your ears off! -Now you're\\r\\nmaking me laugh. -Take this! Come on! Fight! Fight! Fight! We're ''old\\r\\nschool,'' right? Yeah, but you look older! Sit down. Please. Now the moment\\r\\nyou've all been waiting for: The champion selection. The Durmstrang\\r\\nchampion is Viktor Krum. The champion for Beauxbatons. . . . . .is Fleur\\r\\nDelacour. The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory! Excellent! We now have our\\r\\nthree champions. But in the end, only one will go down in history. Only one\\r\\nwill hoist this chalice of champions. . . . . .this vessel of victory. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . .the Triwizard Cup! Harry Potter. Harry Potter? No. No. Harry Potter!\\r\\nGo on, Harry. Harry, for goodness sake. He's a cheat! He's not even 1 7\\r\\nyet! -lt's wrong, l tell you! -You French tart. -Everything is a conspiracy\\r\\ntheory! -Quiet! l can't think! -Everything is a conspiracy theory! -l\\r\\nprotest. -Harry. -l protest! Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?\\r\\n\\r\\n-No, sir. -Did you ask one of the older students. . . -. . .to do it for\\r\\nyou? -No, sir. -You're absolutely sure? -Yes. Yes, sir. -But of course he\\r\\nis lying. -The hell he is! The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful\\r\\nmagical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could've\\r\\nhoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. You seem to\\r\\nhave given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye. lt was once my job to think\\r\\nas dark wizards do, Karkaroff. . . -. . .perhaps you remember. -This\\r\\ndoesn't help, Alastor. Leave this to you, Barty. The rules are absolute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nno choice. He is, as of tonight. . . . . .a Triwizard champion. This can't\\r\\ngo on, Albus. First the Dark Mark. Now this? What do you suggest, Minerva?\\r\\nPut an end to it. Don't let Potter compete. You heard Barty. The rules are\\r\\nclear. Well, the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you\\r\\naccommodate the Ministry? Headmaster, l, too, find it difficult to believe\\r\\nthis mere coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of\\r\\nthese events. . . . . .perhaps we should, for the time being.          let\\r\\n\\r\\nthem unfold. What--? Do nothing? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy, not\\r\\na piece of meat. l agree. With Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will\\r\\nyou? -l can do that. -Don't let him know, though. He must be anxious enough\\r\\nas it is. . . . . .knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are. How did\\r\\nyou do it? Never mind. Doesn't matter. Might've let your best friend know,\\r\\nthough. -Let you know what? -You know bloody well what. l didn't ask for\\r\\nthis to happen, Ron. Okay? -You're being stupid. -Yeah, that's me. Ron\\r\\nWeasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend. l didn't put my name in that cup. l\\r\\ndon't want eternal glory. l just wanna be. . . . Look, l don't know what\\r\\nhappened tonight. . . . . .and l don't know why. lt just did. Okay? Piss\\r\\noff. What a charismatic quartet. Hello. l'm Rita Skeeter. l write for the\\r\\nDaily Prophet. But of course you know that, don't you? lt's you we don't\\r\\nknow. You're the juicy news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat mysteries do the muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls?\\r\\nln short, what makes a champion tick? ''Me, Myself & l'' want to know. Not\\r\\nto mention my rabid readers. So who's feeling up to sharing? Shall we start\\r\\nwith the youngest? Lovely. This is cozy. lt's a broom cupboard. You should\\r\\nfeel right at home, then. Don't mind if l use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?\\r\\nNo. So tell me, Harry. Here you sit, a mere boy of 1 2-- l'm 1 4. Sorry.\\r\\n\\r\\n--about to compete against three students. . . . . .not only vastly more\\r\\nemotionally mature than yourself. . . . . .but who have mastered spells\\r\\nthat you wouldn't attempt. . . . . .in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?\\r\\nl don't know. l haven't really thought about it. Just ignore the quill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, of course, you're no ordinary boy of 1 2, are you? -Fourteen. -Your\\r\\nstory's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past.          that\\r\\n\\r\\nmade you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament? No, l didn't enter.\\r\\nOf course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. Scratch that last.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of your parents, were they alive. . . . . .how do you think they'd\\r\\nfeel? Proud? Or concerned. . . . . .that your attitude shows, at best, a\\r\\npathological need for attention. . . . . .at worst, a psychotic death wish?\\r\\nHey, my eyes aren't ''glistening with the ghosts of my past. '' Harry, I\\r\\ncouldn 't risk sending Hedwig. Since the World Cup, the Ministry's been\\r\\nintercepting more and more owls... ...and she's too easily recognized. We\\r\\nneed to talk, Harry, face-to-face. Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,\\r\\n1:00 this Saturday night. And make sure you're alone. Sirius. P.S.: The\\r\\nbird bites. Sirius? Harry Potter, age 1 2... ...suspect entrant in the\\r\\nTriwizard Tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his past...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n...and choking back tears... Sirius. How--? l don't have much time, so let\\r\\nme get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet\\r\\nof Fire? No! l had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You\\r\\nmentioned Wormtail and Voldemort. But who was the third man in the room? -l\\r\\ndon't know. -You didn't hear a name? No. Voldemort was giving him a job to\\r\\ndo. Something important. And what was that? He wanted. . . . . .me. l don't\\r\\nknow why. But he was gonna use this man to get to me. But, l mean, it was\\r\\nonly a dream, right? Yes. lt's just a dream. Look, Harry. The Death Eaters\\r\\nat the World Cup, your name rising from that goblet. . . . . .these are not\\r\\njust coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore. What are you saying? l'm\\r\\nsaying the devils are inside the walls. lgor Karkaroff? He was a Death\\r\\nEater. And no one, no one stops being a Death Eater. Then there's Barty\\r\\nCrouch. Heart of stone. Sent his own son to Azkaban. You think one of them\\r\\nput my name in the goblet? l haven't a clue who put your name in that\\r\\ngoblet. . . . . .but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this\\r\\ntournament. -l'm not ready for this, Sirius. -You don't have a choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Someone's coming. -Keep your friends close, Harry. -Who were you talking\\r\\nto? -What? -Who says l was talking to anyone? -l heard voices. Maybe you're\\r\\nimagining things. Wouldn't be the first time. You're probably just\\r\\npracticing for your next interview, l expect. Amazing. -Amazing! -Neville.\\r\\nYou're doing it again. Right, sorry. ''Magical Water Plants of the Highland\\r\\nLochs''? Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea. lt's already been\\r\\nthrough enough people. Why don't you just go and talk to him yourself? Ron,\\r\\nthis is your problem, not mine. What do you want me to say again? Go.\\r\\n\\r\\nRonald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him. . . . . .that Dean\\r\\nwas told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you. ls that right? Well,\\r\\nyou-- What? -Are you sure you won't do this? -Do it. Dean was told by\\r\\nParvati that. . . . Please don't ask me to say it again. Hagrid's looking\\r\\nfor you. -Well, you can tell Ronald-- -l'm not an owl! Did you bring your\\r\\nfather's cloak, like l asked you? Yeah, l brought the cloak. Hagrid, where\\r\\n\\r\\nare we going? You'll see soon enough. Now pay attention, this is important.\\r\\nWhat's with the flower? Hagrid, have you combed your hair? As a matter of\\r\\nfact, l have. You might like to try the same thing now and again. Hagrid?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cloak! Put the cloak on! -Bonsoir, Olympe. -Oh, Hagrid. l thought\\r\\nperhaps you weren't coming. l thought perhaps. . . . . .you had forgotten\\r\\nme. Couldn't forget you, Olympe. What is it you wanted to show me? When we\\r\\nspoke earlier, you sounded so. . . . . .exhilarated. You'll be glad you\\r\\ncame. Trust me. Can we get closer? Dragons? That's the first task? -You're\\r\\njoking. -Come on, Harry. These are seriously misunderstood creatures. Oh,\\r\\ncrikey! Although, l have to admit. . . . . .that Horntail is a right nasty\\r\\npiece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him, you know. -Ron was\\r\\nhere? -Oh, sure. His brother Charlie helped to bring him over from Romania.\\r\\nDidn't Ron tell you that? No, he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing. -You\\r\\ncheat, Potter. -You stink, Potter. -Good luck, Potter. -Potter stinks!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-Cedric rules. -Thanks. Like the badge? Excuse me. Harry. Hey! Read the\\r\\nbadge, Potter! Can l have a word? -All right. -You stink, Potter! -Potter,\\r\\nyou stink! -Harry Potter smells! Dragons. That's the first task. -They've\\r\\ngot one for each of us. -Come on, Ced! Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum,\\r\\ndo they--? -Yes. -Come on, Ced, leave him. -Right. -He's not worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Read the badges, Potter! -Hey, listen. About the badges. -l've asked them\\r\\nnot to wear them, but-- -Don't worry about it. lt's not like l try to blow\\r\\nthings up, exactly. lt just happens a fair bit. You have to admit, though,\\r\\nfire's pretty fascinating. You're a right foul git, you know that? -You\\r\\nthink so? -l know so. Anything else? -Yeah. Stay away from me. -Fine.\\r\\n\\r\\n-There's Potter. Cheat. -Why so tense, Potter? My father and l have a bet,\\r\\nyou see. l don't think you're gonna last He disagrees. He thinks you won't\\r\\nlast five. l don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy. He's vile\\r\\nand cruel. And you're just pathetic. -Pathetic? -Oh, no, you don't, sonny!\\r\\nl'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned! You stinking,\\r\\ncowardly, scummy. . . -Professor Moody! -. . .back-shooting-- -What are you\\r\\ndoing? -Teaching. -ls that a--? ls that a student? -Technically, it's a\\r\\nferret. Stand still! Stand still! -My father will hear about this! -ls that\\r\\na threat? -Professor Moody! -ls that a threat? Professor! l could tell you\\r\\nstories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair! -Alastor!\\r\\nAlastor. -lt doesn't end here! We never use transfiguration as a\\r\\npunishment! Surely Dumbledore told you that. -He might've mentioned it.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Well, you will do well to remember it. Away! You. Come with me. That's a\\r\\nFoe-Glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. lf l can see the whites of\\r\\ntheir eyes, they're standing right behind me. Wouldn't even bother telling\\r\\nyou what's in there. You wouldn't believe it if l did. Now.          what\\r\\n\\r\\nare you going to do about your dragon? Well, you know, l just thought l'd.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . Sit. Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age, he could\\r\\nturn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour?\\r\\nShe's as much a fairy princess as l am. As for Krum, his head may be filled\\r\\nwith sawdust. . . . . .but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And\\r\\nyou can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter. What\\r\\nare your strengths? l don't know. Well, l can fly. l mean, l'm a fair\\r\\nflyer. But l. . . . -Better than fair, the way l heard it. -But l'm not\\r\\nallowed a broom. You're allowed a wand. Bets! Place your bets! Bets taken!\\r\\nBets taken here! Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter in today's\\r\\nbloodbath? Smart money's on Krum to survive! Any bets? Yes, sir? Ten-to-1\\r\\nfor Fleur. There you go. Thank you very much. Your attention, please. This\\r\\nis a great day for all of us. Each of the three tasks involves very\\r\\nconsiderable danger. Please keep your seats at all times. This will\\r\\nminimize any risks you may be exposed to. -Harry? ls that you? -Yeah. I'm\\r\\nsure we all wish our champions... -How are you feeling? Okay? -.   the\\r\\n\\r\\ngreatest of luck. The key is to concentrate. After that, you just have to--\\r\\nBattle a dragon. Young love. How. . . . . .stirring. lf everything goes\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately today. . . . . .you two may even make the front page. You\\r\\nhave no business here. This tent is for champions. . . . . .and friends. No\\r\\nmatter. We've got what we wanted. Good day, champions. Gather round,\\r\\nplease. Now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has\\r\\narrived. A moment only four of you can fully appreciate. What are you doing\\r\\nhere, Miss Granger? Sorry, l'll just go. Barty, the bag. Champions, in a\\r\\ncircle around me. Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum. And, Potter, Mr.\\r\\n\\r\\nPotter, over here. That's right. Now. . . . . .Miss Delacour, if you will.\\r\\nThe Welsh Green. Mr. Krum. The Chinese Fireball. The Swedish Short-Snout.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Which leaves. . . . -The Horntail. -What's that, boy? -Nothing. The\\r\\nHungarian Horntail. These represent four very real dragons.          each\\r\\n\\r\\nof which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple:\\r\\nCollect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?\\r\\nVery well. Good luck, champions. Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,\\r\\nyou may-- Diggory! Diggory! Diggory! Three of our champions have now faced\\r\\ntheir dragons... ...and so each one of them will proceed to the next task.\\r\\nAnd now our fourth and final contestant. Harry! Harry! Harry! Your wand,\\r\\nHarry! Your wand! Accio Firebolt! -Yeah! -Yes! Oh, my God. -Yeah! -Yeah!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell done, dragon! Yes! Yes! -Yes, Harry! -Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a\\r\\nleg. -Or an arm. -Pack it in altogether? -Never! -Never! Shush! Go on,\\r\\nHarry. What's the clue? -Who wants me to open it? -Yes! -Do you want me to\\r\\nopen it? -Yes! What the bloody hell was that? All right, everyone! Go back\\r\\nto your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you\\r\\nnosy sods listening in. l reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own\\r\\nname in the Goblet of Fire. Caught on, have you? Took you long enough. l\\r\\nwasn't the only one who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it\\r\\nbehind your back. Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better. -Least l\\r\\nwarned you about the dragons. -Hagrid warned me about the dragons. No, no,\\r\\nno, l did. No, don't you remember? l told Hermione to tell you. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for\\r\\nyou. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along.\\r\\nl thought we'd be all right, you know. . . . . .after you'd figured that\\r\\nout. Who--? Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah. lsn't it? l suppose l was a bit distraught. Boys. -Hi, Harry. -Hi,\\r\\nHarry. Cho, Harry's looking at you. Shush. Look at this! l can't believe\\r\\nit! She's done it again. ''Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. .seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey,\\r\\nsources report. . . . . .is none other than the Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor\\r\\nKrum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.\\r\\n'' Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley. Thank you, Nigel. Not now, Nigel. Later. Go\\r\\non. l told him l'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh, look, Mum's sent me\\r\\nsomething. Mum sent me a dress. Well, it does match your eyes. ls there a\\r\\nbonnet? Nose down, Harry. -Ginny, these must be for you. -l'm not wearing\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthat, it's ghastly. What are you on about? They're not for Ginny. They're\\r\\nfor you. -Dress robes. -Dress robes? For what? The Yule Ball.          has\\r\\n\\r\\nbeen a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament. . . . . .since its inception.\\r\\nOn Christmas Eve night, we and our guests. . . . . .gather in the Great\\r\\nHall. . . . . .for a night of well-mannered frivolity. As representatives\\r\\nof the host school. . . . . .l expect each and every one of you to put your\\r\\nbest foot forward. And l mean this literally, because. . . . . .the Yule\\r\\nBall is, first and foremost. . . . . .a dance. Silence! The house of Godric\\r\\nGryffindor has commanded the respect. . . . . .of the wizard world for\\r\\nnearly 1 0 centuries. l will not have you, in the course of a single\\r\\nevening, besmirching that name. . . . . .by behaving like a babbling,\\r\\nbumbling band of baboons. Try saying that five times fast, huh? Now, to\\r\\ndance. . . is to let the body breathe. lnside every girl, a secret swan\\r\\nslumbers. . . longing to burst forth and take flight. Something's about to\\r\\nburst out of Eloise Midgen, but l don't think it's a swan. lnside every\\r\\nboy, a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr. Weasley. Yes? Will you join me,\\r\\nplease? Now, place your right hand on my waist. Where? My waist. And extend\\r\\nyour arm. Mr. Filch, if you please. One, two, three. One, two, three. One,\\r\\ntwo, three. Never gonna let him forget this, are you? -Never. -Never.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody come together. Boys, on your feet! Why do they have to travel in\\r\\npacks? How are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them? Blimey,\\r\\nHarry. You've slayed dragons. lf you can't get a date, who can? l think l'd\\r\\ntake the dragon right now. l take after my mum. Though l didn't know her\\r\\nvery well. She left when l was about 3. No, not the maternal sort, her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroke me dad's heart, though. He was a tiny little fella, my dad. l could\\r\\npick him up at the age of 6 with one hand and put him up on the dresser. He\\r\\nlaughed so hard at that. Very funny. And then he died just when l started\\r\\nschool, so. . . . So l sort of had to make me own way, as it were. But\\r\\nenough of me. What about you? This is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only\\r\\nones in our year without dates. Well, us and Neville. Yeah, but, then\\r\\nagain, he can take himself. lt might interest you to know that Neville's\\r\\nalready got someone. Now l'm really depressed. ''Get a move on or all the\\r\\ngood ones will have gone. '' Who you going with, then? -Oi, Angelina?\\r\\n\\r\\n-What? Do you wanna go to the ball with me? To the ball? Yeah, all right.\\r\\nOi, Hermione. You're a girl. Very well spotted. Come with one of us? Come\\r\\non. lt's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl, it's just sad.\\r\\nl won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me! And\\r\\nl said yes! Bloody hell. She's lying, right? lf you say so. Look, we've\\r\\njust gotta grit our teeth and do it. Tonight, when we get back to the\\r\\ncommon room. . . . . .we'll both have partners. Agreed? Agreed. -Cho!\\r\\n\\r\\n-Harry! Watch yourself on the stairs. lt's a bit icy at the top. Okay,\\r\\nthanks. Cho? Yes? Well, l just wondered if you-- l wondered if maybe you\\r\\nwanted to go to the ball with me. Sorry, l didn't catch that. l was just\\r\\nwondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. Harry. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.l'm sorry, but someone's already asked me. And. . . . Well, l've said l'll\\r\\ngo with him. Okay. Yeah. Great. Fine. No problem. Okay. Good. Harry? l\\r\\nreally am. . . . . .sorry. lt's all right, Ron. lt's okay, Ron. lt's all\\r\\nright. lt doesn't matter. What happened to you? He just asked Fleur\\r\\nDelacour out. -What? -What did she say? No, of course. -She said yes?\\r\\n\\r\\n-Don't be silly. There she was, walking by. You know how l like it when\\r\\nthey walk. l couldn't help it. lt just sort of slipped out. Actually, he\\r\\nsort of screamed at her. lt was a bit frightening. -And what did you do\\r\\nthen? -What else? l ran for it. l'm not cut out for this, Harry. l don't\\r\\nknow what got into me. -Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry. l always liked looking at\\r\\nthem from behind. She's never gonna forgive me, ever. Hey! Bloody hell.\\r\\nBloody hell. Bloody. . . . Oh, bloody. . . . What are those? What are\\r\\nthose? -My dress robes. -Well, they're all right! No lace. No dodgy little\\r\\ncollar. Well, l expect yours are more traditional. Traditional?! They're\\r\\nancient! l look like my Great Aunt Tessie! l smell like my Great Aunt\\r\\nTessie. Murder me, Harry. Leave it alone! Poor kid. l bet she's alone in\\r\\nher room, crying her eyes out. -Who? -Hermione, of course. Come on, Harry,\\r\\nwhy do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with? Because we'd\\r\\ntake the mickey out of her if she did. Nobody asked her. Would've taken her\\r\\nmyself if she wasn't so bloody proud. -Hello, boys. -Hello, boys. Don't you\\r\\nlook. . . . . .dashing. There you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil\\r\\nready? -Ready, professor? -To dance. lt's traditional that the three\\r\\nchampions-- Well, in this case, four. --are the first to dance. -Surely l\\r\\ntold you that. -No. Well, now you know. As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may\\r\\nproceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil. -Oh, there you are. -Come on,\\r\\nthen. Come along this way. Oh, come on. -Hi. -Now, l need you all to line\\r\\nup. . . . . .in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late. This way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis way. Come along. She looks beautiful! Yeah, she does. ls that Hermione\\r\\nGranger? With Viktor Krum? No. Absolutely not. Hi! Harry, take my waist.\\r\\n\\r\\n-What? -Now! Are you ready? Move your body like a hairy troll Learning to\\r\\nrock and roll Spin around like a crazy elf Dancing by himself Boogie down\\r\\nlike a unicorn No stopping till the break of dawn Put your hands up in the\\r\\nair Like an ogre who just don 't care Can you dance like a Hippogriff?\\r\\n\\r\\nRuddy pumpkinhead, isn't he? l don't think it was the books that had him\\r\\ngoing to the library. May l have your arm? Arm. Leg. l'm yours. Hot, isn't\\r\\nit? Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us? No, we'd\\r\\nnot care to join you and Viktor. What's got your wand in a knot? He's a\\r\\nDurmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy. The enemy? Who was it\\r\\nwanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.is international magical cooperation. . . . . .to make friends. l think\\r\\nhe's got a bit more than friendship on his mind. Are you going to ask me to\\r\\ndance or not? No. -He's using you. -How dare you?! -Besides, l can take\\r\\ncare of myself. -l doubt it. He's way too old. -What?! What? That's what\\r\\nyou think? -Yeah, that's what l think. You know the solution then, don't\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nyou? -Go on. -Next time there's a ball. . . . . .pluck up the courage and\\r\\nask me before somebody else does! And not as a last resort. Well, that's--\\r\\nl mean, that's just completely off the point. Harry. Where have you been?\\r\\nNever mind! Off to bed, both of you. -They get scary when they get older.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Ron, you spoiled everything! What's this about? No, don 't let This magic\\r\\ndie The answer's there Let me see it again. Yes, the time is close now.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, at last! Step aside, Wormtail, so l can give our guest a proper\\r\\ngreeting. You all right, Harry? l just got in. Me. Harry, you told me you'd\\r\\nfigured the egg out weeks ago. -The task is two days from now. -Really? l\\r\\nhad no idea. l suppose Viktor's already figured it out. Wouldn't know. We\\r\\ndon't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at\\r\\nall. Viktor's more of a physical being. l just mean he's not particularly\\r\\nloquacious. Mostly, he watches me study. lt's a bit annoying, actually. You\\r\\nare trying to figure this egg out, aren't you? What's that supposed to\\r\\nmean? lt just means these tasks are designed to test you. . . . . .in the\\r\\nmost brutal way. They're almost cruel. And. . . . . .l'm scared for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou got by the dragons mostly on nerve. l'm not sure it's going to be\\r\\nenough this time. Hey, Potter! -Potter! -Cedric. How--? How are you?\\r\\nSpectacular. l realize l never really thanked you properly for tipping me\\r\\noff about those dragons. Forget it. l'm sure you would've done the same for\\r\\nme. Exactly. You know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor? lt's not a\\r\\nbad place for a bath. Just take your egg. . . . . .and mull things over in\\r\\nthe hot water. l must be out of my mind. l'm definitely out of my mind. l'd\\r\\ntry putting it in the water if l were you. Myrtle! Hello, Harry. Long time\\r\\nno see. l was circling a blocked drain the other day. . . . . .and could\\r\\nswear l saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion. Not being a bad boy again, are you,\\r\\nHarry? Polyjuice Potion? Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, ''Try\\r\\nputting it in the water''? That's what he did. The other boy.          the\\r\\n\\r\\nhandsome one. . . . . .Cedric. Well, go on. Open it. Come seek us Where our\\r\\nvoices sound We cannot sing Above the ground An hour long you'll have to\\r\\nlook To recover what we took Myrtle. . . . . .there aren't merpeople in the\\r\\nBlack Lake, are there? Very good. lt took Cedric ages to riddle it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all the bubbles were gone. Harry, tell me again. ''Come seek us\\r\\nwhere our voices sound. '' The Black Lake, that's obvious. ''An hour long\\r\\nyou'll have to look. '' Again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially\\r\\nproblematic. ''Potentially problematic''? When's the last time you held\\r\\nyour breath underwater for an hour, Hermione? Look, Harry, we can do this.\\r\\nThe three of us can figure it out. Hate to break up the skull session.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor McGonagall wants you in her office. Not you, Potter, just Weasley\\r\\nand Granger. But, sir, the second task is only hours away, and-- Exactly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresumably Potter is well prepared by now. . . . . .and could do with a\\r\\ngood night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom! Why don't you help Potter put his\\r\\nbooks back. You know, if you're interested in plants. . . . . .you'd be\\r\\nbetter off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nin Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees? Neville, no offense, but l\\r\\nreally don't care. . . . . .about plants. Now, if there's.          a\\r\\n\\r\\nTibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. .then great. But otherwise-- l don't know about a turnip. But you could\\r\\nalways use gillyweed. -Any bets? Any bets? -Come on, place your bets! Step\\r\\nup, mates! Don't be shy. -Three lads. -One lady. -Four go down. -But do\\r\\nfour come up? Don't be so mean. -Any bets? -Fleur's 1 0-1 . -You're sure\\r\\nabout this, Neville? -Absolutely. -For an hour? -Most likely. Most likely?\\r\\nWell, there is some debate among herbologists. . . . . .as to the effects\\r\\nof fresh water versus salt water-- You're telling me this now? You must be\\r\\njoking! l just wanted to help. Well, that makes you a right sight better\\r\\nthan Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway? -You seem a little tense,\\r\\nHarry. -Do l? Welcome to the second task. Last night, something was stolen\\r\\nfrom each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one\\r\\nfor each champion... ...now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake. In order\\r\\nto win... ...each champion need only find their treasure and return to the\\r\\nsurface. -Simple enough, except for this: -Put that in your mouth. They\\r\\nwill have but one hour to do so, and one hour only. After that, they'll be\\r\\non their own. No magic will save them. You may begin at the sound of the\\r\\ncannon. -What's the matter with him? -l don't know, l can't see him. Oh, my\\r\\nGod. l've killed Harry Potter. Yeah! What? The Beauxbatons champion, Miss\\r\\nDelacour... ...has unfortunately been forced to retire... ...so she will\\r\\ntake no further part in this task. But she's my friend too! Only one! Let's\\r\\nget down below. Krum! Krum! Krum! Yes! Ascendio! Harry! He's all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe's all right. Barty! -Go get him another towel. -l want all the judges\\r\\nover here now! You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My\\r\\nlittle sister. Thank you. And you! You helped. Well, yeah, a bit. -Harry!\\r\\n\\r\\n-Hermione! Are you all right? You must be freezing. Personally, l think you\\r\\nbehaved admirably. l finished last, Hermione. Next to last. Fleur never got\\r\\npast the Grindylows. Krum! Krum! Krum! -Come on! Come on! -Attention!\\r\\n\\r\\nAttention! The winner is Mr. Diggory. . . . . .who showed innate command of\\r\\nthe Bubble-Head Charm. However, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished\\r\\nfirst. . . . . .had it not been for his determination to rescue not only\\r\\nMr. Weasley. . . . . .but the others as well, we've agreed to award him. .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .second place. . . -Second place! -Well done! . . .for outstanding\\r\\nmoral fiber! Yes! -Right on. -All that moral fiber, eh? -lt's great. -Moral\\r\\nfiber? Blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right. -Yeah, well\\r\\ndone, Moral Fiber. -Congratulations, Potter. -A fine achievement. -Thank\\r\\nyou. Well done, boy. -See you at Hagrid's, Harry. -l'm sorry we haven't\\r\\nspoken. After all, your story is one l've heard so many times. Quite\\r\\nremarkable, really. Tragic, of course. . . . . .to lose one's family. Never\\r\\nwhole again, are we? Still, life goes on. . . . . .and here we stand. l'm\\r\\nsure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter. Bartemius! Not\\r\\ntrying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwe? The last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!\\r\\nAnd they say l'm mad. Now, l remember-- l remember when l first met you\\r\\nall. Biggest bunch of misfits l ever set eyes on. Suppose you remind me of\\r\\nmeself a little. -And here we all are, four years later. -We're still a\\r\\nbunch of misfits. Well, maybe, but we've all got each other. And Harry, of\\r\\ncourse. Soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been!\\r\\n\\r\\nHooray! Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us something, please\\r\\nMr. Crouch? A man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must\\r\\ntake action. l will not. ln times like these, the wizard world looks to its\\r\\nleaders for strength, Dumbledore! Then for once show them some! The\\r\\nTriwizard Tournament will not be canceled. l will not be seen as a coward!\\r\\nA true leader does what is right, no matter what others think. -What did\\r\\nyou say to me? -Excuse me, gentlemen. lt may interest you to know this\\r\\nconversation is no longer private. Oh, Harry! Harry, how good to see you\\r\\nagain. l can come back later, professor. Not necessary, Harry. The minister\\r\\nand l are done. l'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. There you\\r\\nare. Your hat. Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap\\r\\nin my absence. But l have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp. Professor?\\r\\n\\r\\n-Professor. -Yeah. lgor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at\\r\\nyour own request. . . . . .to present evidence to this council. Should your\\r\\ntestimony prove consequential. . . . . .council may be prepared to order\\r\\nyour immediate release. Until such time, you remain in the eyes of the\\r\\nMinistry a convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms? -l do, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n-And what do you wish to present? l have names, sir. There was Rosier, Evan\\r\\nRosier. -Rosier is dead. -He took a piece of me with him. . . -. . .though,\\r\\ndidn't he? -l didn't know. -lf that is all the witness has to offer-- -No,\\r\\nno, no. There was Rookwood! He was a spy. Augustus Rookwood? Of the\\r\\nDepartment of Mysteries? Yeah, the same. He passed information to\\r\\n\\r\\nYou-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself. Very well. Council will\\r\\ndeliberate. ln the meantime, you will return to Azkaban. No! Wait, please!\\r\\nPlease, l have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape? As the council is\\r\\naware, l've given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a Death\\r\\nEater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall. . . -. . .turned spy for us\\r\\nat great personal risk. -lt's a lie! -Today he's no more a Death Eater than\\r\\n\\r\\nl. -Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord! Silence! Unless the witness\\r\\npossesses any genuine name of consequence. . . . . .this session is now\\r\\nconcluded. Oh, no, no, no. l've heard about one more. -What's that? -The\\r\\nname. -Yes? -l know for a fact. . . . . .this person took part in the\\r\\ncapture. . . . . .and, by means of the Cruciatus Curse. . . . . .torture of\\r\\nthe Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife! The name. Give me the wretched\\r\\nname! Barty Crouch. . . . . .Junior. Hold him down! Get your filthy hands\\r\\noff me, you pathetic little men! Hello, Father. You are no son of mine.\\r\\nCuriosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution. lt's a\\r\\nPensieve. Very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlt allows me to see once more things l've already seen. You see, Harry, l\\r\\nhave searched and searched for something. . . . . .some small detail. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. .something l might have overlooked. . . . . .something that would explain\\r\\nwhy these terrible things have happened. Every time l get close to an\\r\\nanswer, it slips away. lt's maddening. Sir? Mr. Crouch's son. What exactly\\r\\nhappened to him? He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he\\r\\nhad no choice. The evidence was overwhelming. -Why do you ask? -lt's just\\r\\nthat l. . . . l had a dream about him. lt was in the summer, before school.\\r\\nIn the dream, I was in a house. And Voldemort was there, only he wasn 't\\r\\nquite human. And Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch 's son. -Have there\\r\\nbeen others like this dream? -Yes. Always the same one. Sir, these dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . . .what l see, you don't think it's actually happening, do you? l\\r\\nthink it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry. l think it's\\r\\nbest if you simply. . . . . .cast them away. lt's a sign, Severus. You know\\r\\nwhat it means as well as l. Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations,\\r\\nyour performance in the Black Lake was inspiring. Gillyweed, am l correct?\\r\\nYes, sir. lngenious. A rather rare herb, gillyweed. Not something found in\\r\\nyour everyday garden. Nor is this. Know what it is? Bubble juice, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nVeritaserum. Three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his\\r\\ndarkest secrets. The use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever. . . . . .should you ever steal from my personal stores again. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . .my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice. -l haven't\\r\\nstolen anything. -Don't lie to me. Gillyweed may be innocuous, but\\r\\nboomslang skin, lacewing flies? You and your little friends are brewing\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion, and believe me. . . . . .l'm going to find out why!\\r\\n\\r\\n-Yeah! -Yeah! Sonorus! Earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard\\r\\nCup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiggory. . . . . .and Mr. Potter. . . . . .are tied for first position. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . .they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum. . . -.\\r\\n\\r\\n. .and Miss Delacour. -Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum! The first person to touch\\r\\nthe cup will be the winner! l've instructed the staff to patrol the\\r\\nperimeter. Should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the\\r\\ntask. . . . . .he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.\\r\\n\\r\\nContestants! Gather around. Quickly! ln the maze, you'll find no dragons or\\r\\ncreatures of the deep. lnstead, you'll face something even more\\r\\nchallenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh, find the cup if you\\r\\ncan. But be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nChampions, prepare yourselves! Good luck. -My boy. -See you later, Dad. On\\r\\nthe count of three. One-- Fleur? Fleur. Periculum! Get down! Get down!\\r\\n\\r\\nExpelliarmus! No, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric! -Get off me! -He's\\r\\nbewitched! Yes. Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! Reducto! -Thanks. -No problem.\\r\\nYou know, for a moment there, l thought you were gonna let it get me. For a\\r\\nmoment, so did l. Some game, huh? Some game. Go! Go on, take it. You saved\\r\\nme, take it! -Together. One, two. . . -Two. . . -. . .three! -.    three!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-You okay? -Yeah. You? Where are we? l've been here before. lt's a Portkey.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Harry, the cup is a Portkey. -l've been here before, in a dream. Cedric!\\r\\nWe have to get back to the cup. Now! What are you talking about? -Harry!\\r\\nWhat is it? -Get back to the cup! -Who are you? What do you want? -Kill the\\r\\nspare. -Avada Kedavra! -No! Cedric! Do it! Now! Bone of the father. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.unwillingly given. Flesh of the servant. . . . . .willingly sacrificed.\\r\\nAnd blood of the enemy. . . . . .forcibly taken. The Dark Lord shall rise.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . . .again. My wand, Wormtail. Hold out your arm. Master. Thank you,\\r\\nmaster. The other arm, Wormtail. Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's\\r\\nbeen, and yet. . . . . .here you stand before me as though it were only\\r\\nyesterday. l confess myself. . . . . .disappointed. Not one of you tried to\\r\\nfind me. Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you. . . . . .Lucius. My Lord,\\r\\nhad l detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts-- There were signs,\\r\\nmy slippery friend. And more than whispers. l assure you, my Lord, l have\\r\\nnever renounced the old ways. The face l have been obliged to present each\\r\\nday since your absence. . . . . .that is my true mask. l returned. Out of\\r\\nfear, not loyalty. Still, you have proved yourself useful these past few\\r\\nmonths, Wormtail. Thank you, master. Thank you. -Such a handsome boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Don't touch him! Harry. l'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on\\r\\nthe bones of my father. Yeah. l'd introduce you. . . . . .but word has it\\r\\nyou're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have\\r\\nfed your legend, Harry. Shall l reveal what really happened that night 1 3\\r\\nyears ago? Shall l divulge how l truly lost my powers? Yes, shall l? lt was\\r\\nlove. You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son.\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . . .she provided the ultimate protection. l could not touch him. lt\\r\\nwas old magic. Something l should have foreseen. But no matter, no matter.\\r\\nThings have changed. l can touch you. . . . . .now. Yeah. Astonishing what\\r\\na few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry? Pick up your wand, Potter. l\\r\\nsaid, pick it up! Get up! Get up! You've been taught how to duel, l\\r\\npresume, yes? First, we bow to each other. Come on, now, Harry. The\\r\\nniceties must be observed. Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your\\r\\nmanners, would he? l said, bow. -That's better. And now. . . . -No. Crucio!\\r\\nCrucio! Attaboy, Harry. Your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy\\r\\nMuggle mother. Expelliar-- l'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. l'm going\\r\\nto destroy you. After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter tonight, if they speak of you. . . . . .they'll speak only of how\\r\\nyou. . . . . .begged for death. And l, being a merciful Lord. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.obliged. Get up! Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter! l want you\\r\\nto look at me when l kill you! l want to see the light leave your eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\nHave it your way. -Expelliarmus! -Avada Kedavra! Do nothing! He's mine to\\r\\nfinish! He's mine! Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to\\r\\nthe Portkey. We can linger for a moment to give you some time.          but\\r\\n\\r\\nonly a moment. Do you understand? Harry, take my body back, will you? Take\\r\\nmy body back to my father. Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go! Let\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ngo! Accio! No! He did it! Harry! Harry! No! No! No, don't! For God's sake,\\r\\nDumbledore, what's happened? He's back. He's back. Voldemort's back.\\r\\n\\r\\nCedric, he asked me to bring his body back. l couldn't leave him, not\\r\\nthere. lt's all right, Harry. lt's all right. He's home. You both are. Keep\\r\\neverybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be\\r\\nmoved, Dumbledore. There are too many people. Let me through. Let me\\r\\nthrough! Let me through! That's my son! That's my boy! lt's my boy! -Come\\r\\non. Get up. Easy, easy! -No. This is not where you want to be right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nCome on. No! lt's all right, l got you. l got you. Come on. Easy, now. No!\\r\\nNo! Are you all right, Potter? Does it hurt? That? Not so much now. Perhaps\\r\\nl'd better take a look at it. The cup was a Portkey. Someone had bewitched\\r\\nit. What was it like? -What was he like? -Who? The Dark Lord. What was it\\r\\nlike to stand in his presence? l don't know. lt was like l'd fallen into\\r\\none of my dreams. . . . . .into one of my nightmares. Were there others? ln\\r\\nthe graveyard, were there others? l. . . . l don't think l said anything\\r\\nabout a graveyard, professor. ''Marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't\\r\\nthey?'' Did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods. .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . . .if l hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would've told\\r\\nyou to open the egg underwater. . . . . .if l hadn't told him first myself?\\r\\nDid you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder.          could've\\r\\n\\r\\nprovided you with gillyweed if l hadn't given him the book.          that\\r\\n\\r\\nled him straight to it? lt was you from the beginning. You put my name in\\r\\nthe Goblet of Fire. -You bewitched Krum, but you-- -''But-- But--'' You won\\r\\nbecause l made it so, Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight\\r\\nbecause it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that\\r\\nruns through these veins runs within the Dark Lord. lmagine how he will\\r\\nreward me when he learns. . . . . .that l have once and for all. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.silenced the great Harry Potter. Expelliarmus! Severus. That's it, take\\r\\nit. -Do you know who l am? -Albus Dumbledore. -Are you Alastor Moody? Are\\r\\nyou? -No. ls he in this room? ls he in this room? Harry, away from there!\\r\\n\\r\\n-You all right, Alastor? -l'm sorry, Albus. That's Moody. But then who's--?\\r\\nPolyjuice Potion. Now we know who's been stealing from your stores,\\r\\nSeverus. We'll get you up in a minute. Harry! Barty Crouch Junior. l'll\\r\\nshow you mine if you show me yours. Your arm, Harry. You know what this\\r\\nmeans, don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned. l'm sorry, sir. l\\r\\ncouldn't help it. Send an owl to Azkaban. l think they'll find they're\\r\\nmissing a prisoner. -l'll be welcomed back like a hero. -Perhaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonally, l've never had much time for heroes. Today, we acknowledge. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . .a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was, as you all know. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.exceptionally hard-working. . . . . .infinitely fair-minded.          and,\\r\\n\\r\\nmost importantly. . . . . .a fierce, fierce friend. Now, l think,\\r\\ntherefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.Cedric Diggory was murdered. . . . . .by Lord Voldemort! The Ministry of\\r\\nMagic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so, l think, would\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbe an insult to his memory. Now, the pain. . . . . .we all feel at this\\r\\ndreadful loss reminds me. . . . . .and reminds us. . . . . .that while we\\r\\nmay come from different places and speak in different tongues.          our\\r\\n\\r\\nhearts beat as one. ln light of recent events. . . . . .the bonds of\\r\\nfriendship we've made this year will be more important than ever. Remember\\r\\nthat, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain. You remember that. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n. . .and we'll celebrate a boy who was. . . . . .kind and honest. . . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n.and brave and true, right to the very end. l never liked these curtains.\\r\\nSet them on fire in my fourth year. By accident, of course. l put you in\\r\\nterrible danger this year, Harry. l'm sorry. Professor. . . . . .when l was\\r\\nin the graveyard, there was a moment. . . . . .when Voldemort's wand and\\r\\nmine sort of connected. Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night,\\r\\ndidn't you? They reappeared. No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. l trust\\r\\nyou know that. Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face\\r\\nthe choice between what is right and what is easy. But remember this: You\\r\\nhave friends here. You're not alone. Hermione. This is for you. Write to\\r\\nme. Promise. Bye. Au revoir, Ron. Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet\\r\\nyear at Hogwarts? -No. -No. No, l didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life\\r\\nwithout a few dragons? Everything's going to change now, isn't it? Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromise you'll write this summer. Both of you. l won't. You know l won't.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Harry will, won't you? -Yeah. Every week.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"}"
