## Description
This is a 3-part data challenge made possible by a client of CTRL F who is a London-based international logistics firm. Each part of the challenge is designed to help this client optimize their cross-border deliveries and ensure affordable, secure, and reliable shipping.
*NOTE: The prize money displayed is the total prize for all three Shipping Optimization Challenges. Please see the Rules section for more info*

Using data from this logistics client with a daily shipment volume ranging from 5,000 to 10,000, you can identify a variety of factors to most effectively choose the ideal freight vendor, reduce shipment costs and duration, and ultimately find the best possible way to deliver goods.

The goal of this competition is to create an algorithm to help this logistics firm choose the best way to ship goods and accurately predict estimated delivery times and shipment quantities.
