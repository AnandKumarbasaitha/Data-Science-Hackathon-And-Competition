## Context
An online auction (or also electronic auction or e-auction or eAuction) is an auction which is held over the internet and there is no in-person bidding available. Bidding can be done on most current computers with an internet connection.

## Problem Statement
Putting out an item for an online auction can be very tricky and even stressful sometimes. You may be struggling with how much you can put as an opening bid or how much the final bid will be. If you were able to predict the final bid, you could simply choose an appropriate opening bid or even decide to not auction the item at all.

## Objective
Build a Machine Learning model to predict the closing price in an online auction.
